Creating a poll in Pawtograder is designed to be quick and straightforward, allowing you to set up a poll in just a few seconds during class.

## Creating a New Poll

1. Navigate to the "Polls" section in your course
2. Click the "Create Poll" button
3. Enter your poll question
4. Select the poll type (see [Poll Types](./poll-types.md) for options)
5. Configure the answer options based on your selected poll type
6. Click "Create" to launch the poll

## Poll Settings

When creating a poll, you can configure the following:

- **Question Text**: The question or prompt displayed to students
- **Poll Type**: The format of responses (single choice or multiple choice)
- **Answer Options**: The available response options for students to choose from
- **Require Login**: When enabled, students must be logged in to Pawtograder to respond to the poll. When disabled, anyone with access to the poll can respond anonymously.

:::tip
Enable **Require Login** if you want to track which students responded or ensure only enrolled students can participate. Disable it for quick anonymous polls where ease of access is more important.

## Automatic Poll Closing

Polls automatically close **one hour** after creation. This ensures that:
- Responses are collected in a timely manner
- Students cannot submit responses long after the class has ended
- Results remain relevant to the in-class discussion

:::tip
If you need to close a poll before the one-hour timeout, you can manually close it at any time from the poll management view.

## Best Practices

- **Keep questions concise**: Students should be able to read and respond quickly
- **Limit answer options**: For multiple choice, 4-5 options is typically ideal
- **Test before class**: Create a test poll to familiarize yourself with the interface
- **Plan ahead**: Have your poll questions ready before class to minimize setup time during lecture
