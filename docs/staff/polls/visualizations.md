Pawtograder provides real-time visualizations for poll results, making it easy to share results with your class during a lecture.

## Viewing Poll Results

After creating a poll, you can view results in real-time as students respond. The results page shows:
- Total number of responses
- A bar chart visualization of responses

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of poll results view -->

## Bar Chart Visualization

Both single choice and multiple choice polls display results as a bar chart:
- Each answer option is shown as a bar
- Bar length corresponds to the number of responses
- Percentages are displayed alongside counts
- Updates in real-time as new responses come in

## QR Code Access

Each class has a unique QR code that allows students to quickly access and respond to polls from their mobile devices.

### How QR Codes Work

- **Class-Specific**: The QR code is tied to your specific class
- **Latest Poll Only**: The QR code always directs students to the **newest active poll** for the class
- **Click to Enlarge**: Click on the QR code to enlarge it for easy projection to the class

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of QR code -->

### Using the QR Code in Class

1. Create a new poll
2. Display the QR code on your projected screen (click to enlarge)
3. Students scan the QR code with their phone camera
4. They are directed to the current poll and can submit their response

:::note
If the poll has **Require Login** enabled, students will be prompted to log in before responding.

## Presenting Results to the Class

To share poll results with your class:

1. Open the poll from the Polls section
2. Project your screen to display results to students

:::tip
Consider hiding results while students are still responding to prevent anchoring bias, then reveal results after closing the poll.

## Exporting Results

Poll results can be exported for record-keeping or further analysis. Export options may include:
- Response counts and percentages
- Individual responses (anonymized)
- Timestamp data
