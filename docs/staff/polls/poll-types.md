Pawtograder supports two poll types to accommodate different polling needs. Each type allows students to respond quickly during class.

## Single Choice

Students select exactly one option from a predefined list.

**Best for:**
- Yes/no or true/false questions
- Questions with one correct answer
- Forced-choice preference questions

**Configuration:**
- Add 2 or more answer options
- Students can select exactly one option

## Multiple Choice

Students can select one or more options from a predefined list.

**Best for:**
- "Select all that apply" questions
- Questions where multiple answers may be correct
- Gathering preferences where students may agree with several options

**Configuration:**
- Add 2 or more answer options
- Students can select multiple options

## Choosing the Right Poll Type

| Poll Type | Response Format | Best Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Single Choice | Select one option | True/false, comprehension checks with one answer |
| Multiple Choice | Select one or more options | "Select all that apply", multiple correct answers |

:::tip
Use **Single Choice** when there's only one correct answer or you want students to commit to a single option. Use **Multiple Choice** when multiple responses may apply.
