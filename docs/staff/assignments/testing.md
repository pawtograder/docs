title: Testing an Assignment
---

Although Pawtograder does *not* provide a feature to "impersonate" a student, it *does* provide a robust feature to allow staff to test an assignment. This feature provisions staff with a repository just like any other student would have, but it does *not* show up in the list of student submissions. You can even mark up the submission with rubric checks to perform a complete end-to-end test of the assignment.

After creating an assignment, you can test it by clicking the "Test Assignment" button, and then clicking "Create Repositories."![Screenshot of the Test Assignment button](assets/testing-1756921042053.png)

After a moment of processing, the page should show a link to your repository. You can then browse that repo, edit things, and commit/push to that repo.

After the submission completes, you'll see a link to view it on that "Test Assignment" page. You may need to refresh the page to see the link, which will only appear once the submission is complete.

The test submission page will look just like it will when viewing a student's submission. You can navigate between rubrics (if applicable) from the dropdown in the right sidebar. You can also navigate between submissions (from students or even from other staff members) from the dropdown in the top bar.
