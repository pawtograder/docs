Programming assignments are the core of Pawtograder. Each assignment consists of a "handout" repository, and optionally, a "grader" repository. When an assignment is released, Pawtograder automatically creates a new private repository for each student based on that handout. Pawtograder automatically manages permissions for all of these repositories, allowing staff to view all of a course's repositories, and ensuring students can only view their own repositories.

## Handout Repositories

A handout repository is a repository that contains the starter code for an assignment. It is used to provide students with the necessary files to complete the assignment.

## Grader Repositories

A grader repository is a repository that contains the code that will be used to grade the assignment. It is used to provide instructors with the necessary files to grade the assignment.
