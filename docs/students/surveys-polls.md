Each survey card displays: - Survey title and description - Due date and time - Current status (Completed or Not Started) - Submission timestamp (if completed)

## Survey Status Filters

Surveys can be filtered by three status categories:

- **All**: View all surveys regardless of completion status
- **Not Started**: Surveys you haven't begun yet
- **Completed**: Surveys you've already submitted

## Taking a Survey

To start a new survey, click the green **Start Survey** button on any survey with "Not Started" status.

Complete all required questions (marked with a red asterisk \*) and submit your responses.

## Editing Your Responses

If editing is enabled for a survey, you'll see a notification at the top of the page:

> "You can edit your response since editing is allowed for this survey."

To edit a completed survey, click **View Submission** on the survey card, modify your responses, and resubmit the survey.

Note: Not all surveys allow editing after submission. Check for the editing notification to confirm.

## Viewing Your Submissions

For completed surveys, click the **View Submission** button on the survey card to review your submitted responses.

If editing is allowed, you can modify and resubmit from this page.
