Polls are a quick and easy way to answer questions during class. Your instructor may use polls to check understanding, gather feedback, or spark discussion.


## Answering Polls

There are two ways to respond to a poll:

### Via QR Code or Link

Your instructor may display a QR code or share a link during class:

1. **Scan the QR code** with your phone camera, or **click the link** provided by your instructor
2. Select your answer(s) from the options displayed
3. Submit your response

If the poll does not require login, you can respond immediately without signing in.

### Via the Polls Page

You can also access polls directly from Pawtograder:

1. Navigate to your course in Pawtograder
2. Go to the "Polls" section
3. Live polls from your class will be displayed
4. Select your answer(s) and submit

## Login Requirements

Polls can be configured by your instructor to require login or allow anonymous responses:

- **Login not required**: You can scan the QR code or use the link to answer immediately without signing in. Your response is anonymous.
- **Login required**: You must sign in to Pawtograder before answering. Your student ID is saved with your response for your instructor's records.

:::note
If a poll requires login and you're not signed in, you'll be prompted to log in before you can submit your response.
